          <h2>About</h2>
          <p id="abttxt">
            My name is Parker Olvera. I was born in Turlock, California and I’ve lived here my whole life.</p>
          <p id="abttxt2">When it comes to hobbies, creating art is my favorite thing to do. Over the course of my years in high school, I became more and more interested in all types of digital art. Two years ago, I got a DSLR camera for my birthday and ever since then, I have been obsessed with photography and photo editing. My senior year of high school, I worked on creating a photography portfolio for one of my classes and I’ve created some of my favorite works during that time. My passion for photography led to developing a love for digital art and eventually graphic design which is what I am majoring in at SJSU.</p>
          <p id="abttxt3">So that’s basically me. I’m a nerdy artist from the central valley who knows about camping. I can’t wait to learn at SJSU and see what life has in store for me.
